# Estimation-Of-Urbanization-Of-Area
Estimation of Urbanization Of An Area Using Image Segmentation Techniques
(Final Year Project)

Description :- The purpose is to substitute the time consuming and exhausting manual work used
for the estimation of urbanization, using only visual photographic satellite images and marginal manual
work with the methods which automatically classify the image blocks of aerial or satellite images
into Built-Up Areas like buildings, roads etc. and Non Built-Up Areas like forests, rivers etc. At last
Graphical representation of Urbanization of an area in terms of ratio of buildings, vegetation and
roads.



The application includes pre-processing of Aerial Image and followed by various image segmentation
techniques. After pre-processing vegetation extraction using Normalized Difference Vegetation
Index (NDVI). Then building extraction is done using edge and corner detection and Hough
transformation. Then classify the different parts of image into Built-Up & Non Built-Up Area. Then
clustering is done for image enhancement using K-Nearest Neighbour Classifier and K mean
Clustering. At last we will represent the estimation of vegetation and building in terms of graphs using
matplot and numpy libraries in python.
